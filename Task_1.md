In Task 1, I created a Java program file that prints "Hello World!" and then pushed it into my GitHub repository 
The commands used were:
1) git clone: to clone this repository onto my local system and to add my program into this local folder
2) git add: to add the program file
3) git status: to check the status of the changes that are committed
4) git commit -m "": to commit these changes
5) git remote set-url: to set the location for pushing the file
6) git push origin main: to finally push the code into this repository
