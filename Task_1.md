In task 1, we had to create a Hello World program in our Github_task folder and push this entire folder to our remote repository. Following were the commands used:
git clone to clone the remote repo to my local system
git add to add the folder 
git commit -m "<message>" to commit these changes(addition of file)
git remote set-url origin <repo path with personal access token>
git push to push these changes finally.
